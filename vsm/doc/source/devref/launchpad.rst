Project hosting with Launchpad
==============================

`Launchpad`_ hosts the Vsm project. The Vsm project homepage on Launchpad is
http://launchpad.net/cinder.

Launchpad credentials
---------------------

Creating a login on Launchpad is important even if you don't use the Launchpad
site itself, since Launchpad credentials are used for logging in on several
OpenStack-related sites. These sites include:

 * `Wiki`_
 * Gerrit (see :doc:`gerrit`)
 * Jenkins (see :doc:`jenkins`)

Mailing list
------------

The mailing list email is ``openstack@lists.launchpad.net``. This is a common
mailing list across the OpenStack projects. To participate in the mailing list:

#. Join the `Vsm Team`_ on Launchpad.
#. Subscribe to the list on the `OpenStack Team`_ page on Launchpad.

The mailing list archives are at https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack.


Bug tracking
------------

Report Vsm bugs at https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder

Feature requests (Blueprints)
-----------------------------

Vsm uses Launchpad Blueprints to track feature requests. Blueprints are at
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder.

Technical support (Answers)
---------------------------

Vsm uses Launchpad Answers to track Vsm technical support questions. The Vsm
Answers page is at https://answers.launchpad.net/cinder.

Note that the `OpenStack Forums`_ (which are not hosted on Launchpad) can also
be used for technical support requests.
