Continuous Integration with Jenkins
===================================

Vsm uses a `Jenkins`_ server to automate development tasks. The Jenkins
front-end is at http://jenkins.openstack.org. You must have an
account on `Launchpad`_ to be able to access the OpenStack Jenkins site.

Jenkins performs tasks such as:

`gate-cinder-unittests`_
    Run unit tests on proposed code changes that have been reviewed.

`gate-cinder-pep8`_
    Run PEP8 checks on proposed code changes that have been reviewed.

`gate-cinder-merge`_
    Merge reviewed code into the git repository.

`cinder-coverage`_
    Calculate test coverage metrics.

`cinder-docs`_
    Build this documentation and push it to http://cinder.openstack.org.

`cinder-pylint`_
    Run `pylint <http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint>`_ on the cinder code and
    report violations.

`cinder-tarball`_
    Do ``python setup.py sdist`` to create a tarball of the cinder code and upload
    it to http://cinder.openstack.org/tarballs
